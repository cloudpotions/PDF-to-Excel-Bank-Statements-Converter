PDF to Excel Bank Statement Converter: The Tool Big Finance Forgot to Build (works on Linux / Mac OS and Windows)  

Banks have mastered a special kind of digital irony: they'll happily store and provide your statements from 7+ years ago as PDFs, but ask for that same data in Excel format and suddenly they act like you've requested nuclear launch codes. This project was born from that exact frustration during tax season, when I discovered that even expensive "professional" solutions like Adobe Acrobat Pro and Nitro PDF utterly failed at the seemingly simple task of converting bank statements to usable spreadsheets.

So, without any paid viable solutions, I decided to create my own Python script to do the job. To my amazement, it worked **flawlessly** and did what Big Tech has failed to do.

This script is far superior for processing PDF Bank statements to excel because it uses targeted libraries like pdfplumber, pandas, and openpyxl to accurately extract and organize transaction data without the pitfalls of OCR technology. Unlike Adobe, which relies on OCR that can misinterpret text and disrupt the order of transactions, this script directly extracts data from the PDF's structure, ensuring precision and maintaining the original sequence. It also automates batch processing, generates detailed verification sheets, and provides financial summaries, making it a highly efficient and reliable solution tailored specifically for this task.

Universal Compatibility: Need to process statements from a different bank? The framework adapts effortlessly across financial institutions. Simply share the python file in this repo along with a sample PDF statement (or screenshot) to a compatabile Ai, and it should be able to tweak the script for you easily. I am also available for consulting - https://www.linkedin.com/in/ellis-jesse/

So if you're like me, trapped in the PDF banking purgatory with years of statements that refuse to cooperate with modern financial tools, you've finally found your escape route...

## Why This Script Rocks for converting Bank PDF Statements to Excel

1. **Accurate Sorting**: The script organizes the data **exactly as it appears in the PDF**. It doesn‚Äôt mess up the order or randomly sort by dates. This is crucial because when you‚Äôre done converting, you‚Äôll want to compare the PDF and Excel side by side to ensure everything lines up perfectly.

2. **Handles Large Volumes**: While I tested it with 12 months of statements, this script can handle much more. Whether you have a year‚Äôs worth of data or several years, it will process everything efficiently.

3. **Customizable**: If you‚Äôre not using Chase Bank, you can easily tweak the script to work with other banks. Just provide the script to your favorite AI (like ChatGPT) along with screenshots of your bank‚Äôs PDF format and a description of the columns you need.

4. **Saves Time**: This script processes thousands of transactions in under a minute. Compare that to Adobe Pro or other paid tools, which are slower and less accurate.

5. **Free and Open Source**: Unlike expensive software, this tool leverages the power of Python and open-source libraries like `pdfplumber` and `pandas`. It‚Äôs completely free to use.

## How It Works

This script is a **GUI based tool**, so you don‚Äôt need to be a programmer to use it. Here‚Äôs what it does:

1. **Select PDF Folder**: A pop-up window will ask you to select a folder with all the PDF documents you wish to process. It will process ALL PDF in that folder, so make sure you do not run it in Downloads folder - Save your PDF files to a new Folder (For example, Chase Bank Statements 2024 Folder)

2. **Output Location**: The output file will be saved in the same folder that the PDFs are located in Step 1

 The script extracts transaction data from the PDFs and organizes it into a clean Excel spreadsheet with columns like:

   - Date of Transaction
   - Statement Date 
   - Description
   - Amount
   - Balance
   - Original Line
   - Source File

When the script is complete, the pop-up box will give you some statistics like how many files were processed and lines were added to the XLSX excel file. It will save the file with a naming convention of FolderName/Date/Time.xlsx

Special Note: You must have Python installed on your OS along with the libraries pdfplumber, pandas, and openpyxl. To use the script, download PDF-2-Excel.py from this repository and run the script and the Gui will do the rest! I am also going to include very detailed Installation instruction at the bottom of this ReadME file for newbies that do not know how to run Python Files with dependencies... 


Even though the script maintains exact PDF order, manual review is essential! 

My suggestion for Double Entry Accounting with my script: 

1. Open the PDF and the generated Excel side-by-side
2. Review page-by-page (e.g., January 2024, then February 2024,etc). 
3. Use a physical notepad with a pen to o to mark each confirmed section you have double checked.
4. Once you are done, repeat steps 1-3 AGAIN! Do not be lazy. The program will most likely do all of the work for you (I have never seen a mistake yet in my testing), but it still requires human intervention and eyes to be safe!

Happy converting! üöÄ

     ```
     chmod +x pdf-2-excel.py
     ```
   - Run the script:
     ```
     python3 pdf-2-excel.py
     ```

### Linux Setup

#### Option 1: Quick Setup (Easiest but Option 2 is recommended below as it is safer) 

This method works on most Linux systems but uses the `--break-system-packages` flag, which bypasses some system protections.

1. **Install Python and Required Tools**
   - Open Terminal and run:
     ```
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-tk
     ```
   - For Fedora/RHEL:
     ```
     sudo dnf install python3 python3-pip python3-tkinter
     ```

2. **Install Required Packages**
   - In Terminal, run:
     ```
     pip3 install --break-system-packages pdfplumber pandas openpyxl
     ```
   - **Note:** This flag overrides system package protections but is the simplest approach.

3. **Run the Script**
   - Download `pdf-2-excel.py` from this repository
   - Make the script executable:
     ```
     chmod +x pdf-2-excel.py
     ```
   - Run the script:
     ```
     python3 pdf-2-excel.py
     ```

#### Option 2: Using a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
This method is safer but requires a few more commands:

1. **Install Python and Required Tools**
   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv python3-tk
   ```

2. **Create and Activate Virtual Environment**
   ```
   python3 -m venv chase_env
   source chase_env/bin/activate
   ```
   After running these commands, your terminal prompt should change to show "(chase_env)" at the beginning, indicating the virtual environment is active.

3. **Install Required Packages in the Virtual Environment**
   ```
   pip install pdfplumber pandas openpyxl
   ```

4. **Run the Script** 
   Make sure you're still in the activated virtual environment (you should see "(chase_env)" in your prompt) and in the same directory as the script. If you need to navigate to your downloads folder:
   ```
   cd ~/Downloads  # or wherever you saved the script
   python pdf-2-excel.py
   ```

5. **When Finished**
   To exit the virtual environment when you're done:
   ```
   deactivate
   ```
```
